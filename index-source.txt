<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

	This document specifies the values that should be used in the
	{{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute to encode the key's
	meaning. The {{KeyboardEvent/key}} value will differ based on the user's
	current locale. For a key value that is based only on the key's physical
	location and does not vary based on locale, see {{KeyboardEvent/code}}
	described in [[!UIEvents-Code]].

	This specification was formerly titled <em>DOM Level 3 KeyboardEvent
	{{KeyboardEvent/key}} Values</em>.

	<h3 id="style-conventions">Stylistic Conventions</h3>

		This specification uses the following conventions:

		*   The <a><em>key cap</em></a> printed on a key is shown as
			KEYCAP{&darr;}, KEYCAP{=} or KEYCAP{Q}. This is used to refer to a
			key from the user's perspective without regard for the
			{{KeyboardEvent/key}} and {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values in the
			generated {{KeyboardEvent}}.

		*   Glyphs representing character are shown as: GLYPH{&#x239C2;}.

		*   Unicode code points are shown as: UNI{U+003d}.

		*   Names of key values generated by a key press (i.e., the value of
			{{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/key}}) are shown as:
			KEY{ArrowDown}, KEY_NOLINK{=}, KEY_NOLINK{q} or KEY_NOLINK{Q}.

		*   Names of key codes associated with the physical keys (i.e., the
			value of {{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/code}}) are shown as:
			CODE{ArrowDown}, CODE{Equal} or CODE{KeyQ}.

<h2 id="key-value-tables">Keyboard Event {{KeyboardEvent/key}} Value Tables</h2>

	This document defines the list of {{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/key}}
	values which implementations MUST support, at a minimum, in addition to
	support for the full range of Unicode [[!Unicode]] codepoints. The
	{{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute of an event MUST always contain one of these
	control key or character values (even if the value is KEY{Unidentified}). If
	the key represents one of the set of printable control characters which has
	a Unicode character entry, such as the tab key, the {{KeyboardEvent/key}}
	attribute MUST have the key value (e.g., KEY{Tab}).

	Implementations that are unable to identify a key MUST use the key value
	KEY{Unidentified}.

	<p class="warning">
	Conforming implementations MUST only use KEY{Unidentified} as a key value
	when there is no way for the implementation to detect the key value.
	Exposing only this value MUST NOT indicate a conforming implementation.
	</p>

	The <a>key values</a>
	defined in this specification are based in part on the sets of keycodes from
	the <code>java.awt.event.KeyEvent</code> interface of the Java Platform,
	Standard Edition 6 API Specification [[KeyEventJava]], and the
	<code>System.Windows.Forms.Keys</code> key enumeration of the Microsoft .NET
	Framework 4.0 Class Library [[KeysNet]]. Additional information in this spec
	comes from Microsoft's WM_APPCOMMAND messages [[WmAppCommand]], and other
	more specialized specifications as noted in this document.

	<p class="note">
	The keys on the numeric keypad (e.g., the keypad KEYCAP{1} key) do not
	generate distinct {{KeyboardEvent/key}} values from their non-keypad
	counterparts (e.g., the KEYCAP{1} key in the main part of the keyboard). The
	{{KeyboardEvent/location}} attribute can be used to determine if a key
	originated from the numeric keypad.
	</p>

	<p class="note">
	Characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (for example UNI{U+239C2} for
	GLYPH{&#x239C2;}, a Chinese character meaning <q>untidy</q>), are, like all
	Unicode values, represented in this spec using the standard <code>U+</code> notation.
	For programming languages that do not directly support this notation, it will
	need to be converted as appropriate, possibly making use of surrogate pairs:
	<code>\uD84e\uDDC2</code> (for ECMAScript),
	<code>&amp;#x239C2;</code> for HTML,
	<code>\U000239c2</code> for C, et al.
	</div>

	The following sub-sections contain the normative list of case-sensitive key
	values, their character values (where applicable), an informative
	description of typical usage, and an informative categorization.  A
	conforming implementation of the {{KeyboardEvent}} interface MUST support at
	least this set of values for use in the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attributes,
	though not all values MAY be available on all platforms or devices.

	Future versions of this specification MAY include key values not included
	here, which have become common since the publication of this specification.
