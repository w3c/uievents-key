<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

	This document specifies the set of valid [=key attribute values=] that MUST be used
	in the {{KeyboardEvent}}'s {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute to encode the key's
	meaning. Note that the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} value for a particular key will differ
	based on the user's current locale setting. For a value that is based only on the key's
	physical location on the keyboard and does not vary based on locale, see
	{{KeyboardEvent/code}} described in [[!UIEvents-Code]].

	<h3 id="style-conventions">Stylistic Conventions</h3>

		This specification uses the following conventions:

		*   The <em>[=key cap=]</em> printed on a key is shown as
			KEYCAP{&darr;}, KEYCAP{=} or KEYCAP{Q}. This is used to refer to a
			key from the user's perspective without regard for the
			{{KeyboardEvent/key}} and {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values in the
			generated {{KeyboardEvent}}.

		*   Glyphs representing character are shown as: GLYPH{a}, GLYPH{é},
			GLYPH{ر}, GLYPH{字}.

		*   Unicode [[!Unicode]] code points are shown as: UNI{U+003d}.

		*   Valid [=key attribute values=] (i.e., the value of
			a {{KeyboardEvent}}'s {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute) are shown as:
			KEY{ArrowDown}, KEY_NOLINK{=}, KEY_NOLINK{q} or KEY_NOLINK{Q}.

		* Valid [=key code attribute values=] (i.e., the
			value of a {{KeyboardEvent}}'s {{KeyboardEvent/code}} attribute) are shown as:
			CODE{ArrowDown}, CODE{Equal} or CODE{KeyQ}.

<h2 id="key-attr-values">Keyboard Event {{KeyboardEvent/key}} Attribute Values</h2>

	A <dfn>key attribute value</dfn> is defined as being a string that contains one of
	the following:

	* A [=key string=] that corresponds to
		the character typed by the user, taking into account the user's current locale
		setting, modifier state, and any system-level keyboard mapping overrides that are
		in effect.

	* A [=named key attribute value=], as defined by the tables in this document.

	A [=key attribute value=] MUST always contain a value that falls into one of these
	two categories (even if the value is KEY{Unidentified}).

	It is acceptable for multiple keys on a keyboard to generate the same
	[=key attribute value=]. For example, on an EN-US keyboard layout, the keys on the
	numeric keypad (e.g., the keypad KEYCAP{1} key) will generate the same
	[=key attribute values=] as their non-keypad counterparts (e.g., the KEYCAP{1} key
	in the main part of the keyboard). The {{KeyboardEvent}}'s
	{{KeyboardEvent/location}} attribute can be used to determine if a key
	originated from the numeric keypad.

	<h3 id="keys-unicode">Unicode Values</h3>

		Almost every Unicode character can be used as a valid [=key attribute value=], but
		there is a small set of Unicode characters which MUST NOT be used.
		We introduce the concept of a [=key string=] to identify the set of
		Unicode strings that are appropriate for use as a [=key attribute value=].

		A <dfn>key string</dfn> is a string containing a 0 or 1 [=non-control characters=]
		("base" characters) followed by 0 or more [=combining characters=]. The string MUST
		be in Normalized Form C (NFC) as described in [[!UnicodeNormalizationForms]].
		
		A <dfn>non-control character</dfn> is any valid Unicode character except
		those that are part of the "Other, Control" ("Cc") General Category.

		A <dfn>combining character</dfn> is any valid Unicode character in the
		"Mark, Spacing Combining" ("Mc") General Category or with a non-zero
		Combining Class.
		
		<div class="example">
			The following are some examples of simple [=key strings=]:
		
			* KEY_NOLINK{a}, KEY_NOLINK{A}, KEY_NOLINK{b}, KEY_NOLINK{B}, ...,
				KEY_NOLINK{å}, KEY_NOLINK{é}, KEY_NOLINK{ü}, KEY_NOLINK{ñ}
		
			* KEY_NOLINK{@}, KEY_NOLINK{%}, KEY_NOLINK{$}, KEY_NOLINK{*}, ...,
				KEY_NOLINK{0}, KEY_NOLINK{1}, KEY_NOLINK{2}
			
			* KEY_NOLINK{あ}, KEY_NOLINK{日}, KEY_NOLINK{中}, ...,
				KEY_NOLINK{一}, KEY_NOLINK{二}, KEY_NOLINK{三}

			* KEY_NOLINK{&#x0627;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x0628;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x0629;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x062A;}, ...,
				KEY_NOLINK{&#x0661;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x0662;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x0663;}

			* KEY_NOLINK{&#x0430;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x0431;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x0432;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x0433;}
			
			* KEY_NOLINK{&#x00B1;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x02B6;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x03F6;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x0D79;}, KEY_NOLINK{&#x2109;}
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			With the exception of KEYCAP{Tab} and KEYCAP{Enter} (see [[#control]]),
			all non-control whitespace Unicode characters are considered to
			be valid [=key strings=].
			
			* KEY_NOLINK{&#x0020} = UNI{U+0020} Space

			* KEY_NOLINK{&#x00a0} = UNI{U+00a0} No-Break Space
			
			* KEY_NOLINK{&#x2009} = UNI{U+2009} Thin Space

			* KEY_NOLINK{&#x3000} = UNI{U+3000} Ideographic Space
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			The following are some examples of [=key strings=] with [=combining characters=]:
		
			* KEY_NOLINK{&#x00f4} = UNI{U+00f4}
				(NOT "o" + " &#x0302" (UNI{U+006f} UNI{U+0302})
				because pre-composed characters must be used if available)

			* KEY_NOLINK{&#x1e0d&#x0307} = UNI{U+1e0d} + UNI{U+0307}
				(NOT "d" + " &#x0323" + " &#x0307" (UNI{U+0064} UNI{U+0323} UNI{U+0307})
				because precomposed characters must be used if available,
				and NOT "&#x1e0b" + " &#x0323" (UNI{U+1e0b} UNI{U+0323})
				because accents must be ordered before substituting with a precomposed version)
		</div>
		
		<h4 id="control">Control Characters</h4>
		
			A small number of characters in the Unicode "Cc" General Category are
			supported as [=named key attribute values=]. These named values are as
			follows:
			
			* UNI{U+0008} KEY{Backspace}

			* UNI{U+0009} KEY{Tab}

			* UNI{U+000D} KEY{Enter}

			* UNI{U+001B} KEY{Escape}

			* UNI{U+007F} KEY{Delete}
		
	<h3 id="selecting-key-attribute-values">Selecting {{KeyboardEvent/key}} Attribute Values</h3>

		A <dfn>glyph modifier key</dfn> is any of the following modifier keys:
		KEYCAP{Shift}, KEYCAP{CapsLock} or KEYCAP{AltGr}.
		
		<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="clipboard-read">
		<h4 id="h-clipboard-read"><dfn>select an appropriate key attribute value</dfn></h4>
		To [=select an appropriate key attribute value=] to store in a {{KeyboardEvent}}'s
		{{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute, run these steps:

			1. Let |key| be a DOMString initially set to KEY{Unidentified}.
			
			1. If there exists an appropriate [=named key attribute value=] for this
				key event, then
				
				1. Set |key| to that [=named key attribute value=].

			1. Else, if the key event generates a valid [=key string=], then
			
				1. Set |key| to that [=key string=] value.

			1. Else, if the key event has any modifier keys other than [=glyph modifier keys=], then

				1. Set |key| to the [=key string=] that would have been generated
					by this event if it had been typed with all modifer keys removed
					except for [=glyph modifier keys=].

			1. Return |key| as the [=key attribute value=] for this key event.

			<p class="example">
				On a standard US keyboard, the [=key attribute value=] for the key labeled
				KEYCAP{Q} is KEY_NOLINK{q} (or KEY_NOLINK{Q} if the KEYCAP{Shift} modifier
				key is also held).
			</p>

			<p class="example">
				On a standard US keyboard, [=key attribute value=] for KEYCAP{Control} +
				KEYCAP{Q} is KEY_NOLINK{q}.
			</p>

			<p class="example">
				On a US keyboard with a right-handed Dvorak key mapping, the
				[=key attribute value=] for the key labeled KEYCAP{Q} is
				KEY_NOLINK{5} (or KEY_NOLINK{%} with KEYCAP{Shift} modifier).
			</p>

			<p class="example">
				On the same US Dvorak keyboard layout as the previous example, the
				[=key attribute value=] for KEYCAP{Control} + KEYCAP{Q} is KEY_NOLINK{5}.
			</p>
			
			<p class="example">
				On a Bolnagri keyboard layout, the [=key attribute value=] for the
				key labeled KEYCAP{Q} is a string containing the single Unicode
				character UNI{U+200C} (ZWNJ or Zero Width Non-Joining Space).
			</p>

			<p class="example">
				On a French PC keyboard with a standard French mapping, the KEYCAP{^}
				key acts as a [=dead key=] for the combining circumflex diacritical mark.
				The [=key attribute value=] for this keyboard event is KEY{Dead}.
			</p>

			<p class="example">
				Also on a French keyboard with a standard French mapping, the
				[=key attribute value=] for the KEYCAP{é} key (which corresponds to the
				KEYCAP{2} key on a US keyboard) is KEY_NOLINK{é} (UNI{U+00E9}).
			</p>

			<p class="example">
				On a Korean PC keyboard with a standard Korean mapping, the primary
				function of the KEYCAP{Ha/En} key is to switch between Hangul and English
				input. There is an entry for this key as a [=named key attribute value=],
				KEY{HangulMode}, so that should be used as the [=key attribute value=].
			</p>

		</div>

	
<h2 id="named-key-attribute-values">Named {{KeyboardEvent/key}} Attribute Values</h2>

	A <dfn>named key attribute value</dfn> is any of the values given in the
	[=key attribute value=] column of any of the tables in this section of the
	specification.
	
	The [=named key attribute values=] defined here are based
	in part on the sets of keycodes from
	the <code>java.awt.event.KeyEvent</code> interface of the Java Platform,
	Standard Edition 6 API Specification [[KeyEventJava]], and the
	<code>System.Windows.Forms.Keys</code> key enumeration of the Microsoft .NET
	Framework 4.0 Class Library [[KeysNet]]. Additional information in this spec
	comes from Microsoft's WM_APPCOMMAND messages [[WmAppCommand]], and other
	more specialized specifications as noted in this document.

	A conforming implementation of the {{KeyboardEvent}} interface MUST support
	this set of values for use in the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attributes,
	although not all values may be available on all platforms or devices.

	Future versions of this specification may include {{KeyboardEvent/key}} values not included
	here, which have become common since the publication of this specification.

	<p class="note">	
	Note: While every attempt has been made to make this list of values as complete as possible,
	new values will periodically need to be defined as new input devices are introduced.
	Rather than allowing user agents to define their own [=named key attribute values=]
	(which are unlikely to be consistent across multiple user agents), bugs SHOULD be
	filed so that this specification can be updated.
	</p>
